*every thread is having a unique id
*t1 represents main thread
*by setName() method we can modify name of thread but id of a thread cant be modified
*hence we may have two threads of same name
*1 is min priority ,10 is max priority, 5 is normal priority
*getPriority() method is used to measure priority and setPreority()method is
*used to modify priority b/w 1 to 10
*in any programming language threads are two types 
*1.Daemon thread
*2.User thread
*main thread is a user thread that is why isDaemon() method here is returning false
*we can convert user to Daemon and Daemon to user but  before start() method
*we can change the daemon status before starting the thread
*child thread priority depends on parent thread priority(priority of parent inheriting 
*to child).
